Sid on the beat, I'm feelin' like Danzō
Givin' eyes to my bros
If it's Mhzin again
Then we pull up and let it blow (uh-huh)

Wanna know why she throw it for Danzō?
I played that girl with the Genjutsu I wrote

Look at all these eyes,
My arm’s stacked like a damn museum
Droppin’ Genjutsus non-stop
Got you trapped in the dream, can't leave it

Haters talkin’ mad,
Say I’m fake and outta line
But I’m too cold and too strong
And I ain’t givin’ up my shine

Yeah, she throw it for Danzō
Stackin’ Sharingan, I ain't done countin’
When I’m in charge, I promise one thing:
Every Kekkei Genkai? I’m the one fundin’

She throw it for Danzō
Hokage throne is the end of the plan
I'll play you and ghost — don’t get too attached
Tell that girl I’m on Danzō mode again

She throw it for Danzō, never for Hiruzen
Special ops, loyal gang, locked in
Movin’ like Sai, passin’ secrets you ain’t heard of
She still throwin’ while the fake ninjas askin’: “Who?”
Mizukage want the Nekage at the Kage Summit
Shorty too bad, she a problem — straight fire, no bluffin’

Call me the Shadow Hokage
I’m the one runnin’ the Anbu moves
Seein’ things they could never see
This ain’t déjà vu — that loop’s the truth

Got an eye for every day in the month
Look at me — too late, now you done
She already threw it once for Danzō
Then got hooked on the shape of the Tomoe

Slick with Itachi’s stare
On the streets, I pull Shisui’s glare
Madara’s eye? I flash it in your face
Then warp her out through Kamui’s gate

Intangible moves, I’m ghostin’ through
Kotoamatsukami, bendin’ your truth
Sasuke’s eye? I’m takin’ that soon
Even Karin know the old head got juice

Pass the Sharingan to daddy’s cane
She impressed, now she hostage again
Pulled up, she threw it — wow, wow

I'm the new Hokage, aka Flow Ninja
I signed off on the Uchiha massacre
‘Cause Tobirama made me that cold sinner

So hand me the eye — don’t hold out
Yeah, I gave the greenlight to wipe your whole house
Now you wanna get revenge, think you’re that guy?
Just ‘cause your eye changed? Got a Susanoo? Bye.

You saw what the Tsukuyomi do?
You lost in my Mangekyō view
Izanami had ‘em stuck on repeat
Izanagi flipped the world for me

That’s why she throw it for Danzō,
Countin’ Sharingans like they trophies
When I lead, I’ll back every dope gene
If it's rare, then it's mine — yeah, I own it

She throw it for Danzō
Hokage spot still the goal, I’m on it
Might play with your heart, might sell you a dream
Tell that girl tonight I’m full Danzō scene

Ten to zero on these rookies
Face covered, but I see through the lies
Arrow loaded — yeah, I let it fly
So many illusions, can't tell what’s real life

I got Hashirama cells, bro
Stop your Susanoo mid-cast, no joke
If I gotta go, then we all go down
No clan, no fam, no bros around
(Hahaha)

Look at all these eyes
My arm? That thing’s maxed out
Genjutsu floodin’ nonstop
Got you lost in the trip, can’t tap out

Haters hatin’ again
Callin’ me fake with no reason
But I’m the traitor with power
Ain’t givin’ up my vision

She throw it for Danzō
Countin’ Sharingan, I ain’t done
When I rise, I promise this, son:
Every rare bloodline? I’m fundin’ the run

She throw it for Danzō
That Hokage title’s still part of the plan
Might backstab you, just don’t fall in love
Let shorty know I’m on that Danzō jam

She throw it for Danzō, never for Hiruzen
Special ops, my crew stay movin’
Like Sai, sendin’ news you ain't read yet
She throw it while clowns ask: “Who’s next?”

Mizukage want the Nekage in the council seat
She dangerous, bad — that girl’s heat! 🔥
