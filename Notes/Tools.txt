FIRST:
Hello, world! Is that correct? I guess so. Damm man, 30 words is a lot. Wow, I saw that it helps at the exact moment the mistake happens. That's kinda cool. Let's try to add something wrong to see if it corrects me. Ok, I tried a lot, but I'm too good, look at that, two hundred words,  I'm still not getting a single error. It was my first real mistake, and I won't get upset. It's not that bad, I won't pisse me off.
