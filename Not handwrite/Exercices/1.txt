Describe your ideal weekend.

My perfect weekend startS with a [cool->NICE] breakfast to start [the Saturday -> on Saturday(mais natural)]. After [this-> that/then], I want to finish everything remaIning from the week, such as work and other reponsIbilities. Probably it's midDay, so I start playING on my PC, read a book and watch a movie [at->ON] channel 4. At Sunday, I go out, have some fun and watch the football game of my team.


--  By then, it’s probably midday // better
-- Canal e dias da semana usa-se ON
-- my team’s football game
