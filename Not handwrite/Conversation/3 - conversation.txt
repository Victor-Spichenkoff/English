[1]Actually, I've never. But I already[2] had to hide some bad grades when I was in 8th grade. I was hard, specially[3] because I thought I'm[4] gonna need to make the notes recovery[5] for the first time ever. But happily[6], using the other grades I already had, I was able to overcome that without let[7] my parents notice. The worst they have seen[8] was a grade a little bit lower on my school report, but nothing to worry[10]
