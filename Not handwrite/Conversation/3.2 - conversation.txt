wrinkled -> amassadas/enrugadas
milenar -> ancient  ou legendary 
=============================================================




Youâ€™re in a rush and your clothes are all wrinkled.
What do you do?
-----
Would you get them ironed, or just wear them like that?
1 - Not even in[0] a normal day I would do it[1]. But if I have[2] someone to get my clothes ironed it would be aweasome[3]. Saddly[4], most of the days[5] I don't have enough time for it, even if the clothes get really beautiful to a point they start looking like new.[6]

[0] ON
[1] Em frases com inicio negativo, precisa inverter -> ...day would I do it.
[2] HAD -> hipotÃ©tico == passado
[3] awesome
[4] Sadly (um "d" sÃ³)
[5] most days -> mais natural
[6] v1 - even if the clothes get really beautiful to a point they start looking like new
    v2 - even if ironed clothes look so good they almost seem brand new

Not even on a normal day would I do it. But if I had someone to get my clothes ironed, it would be awesome. Sadly, most days I donâ€™t have enough time for it â€” even if ironed clothes look so good they almost seem brand new.

Alright, now imagine this:

Your phone falls in the toilet ğŸš½.
Youâ€™re freaking out.
Whatâ€™s the first thing you do?
And do you try to get it fixed, or just buy a new one?

2- Hollyshit[1] man, not even mention it[2]. But if it happens[3], I would try using a milenar[4] brazillian technique: put the phone in the rise[RICE] and hope it to[6] turn on again. If it doesn't work, I will need to get my phone repaired

[1] holy shit
[2] donâ€™t even mention it! (mais natural)
[3] happened -> Ã© passado + would (situaÃ§Ã£o hipotÃ©tica)
[4] ancient  ou legendary (mais cÃ´mico)
[6] apÃ³s hope nÃ£o se usa to. hope it turns on

Holy shit, man â€” donâ€™t even mention it!
But if it happened, Iâ€™d try using an ancient Brazilian technique: putting the phone in rice and hoping it turns on again.
If it doesnâ€™t work, Iâ€™ll need to get my phone repaired.
