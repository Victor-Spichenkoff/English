Let’s have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

---

She is saying the song is really nice and dancing. The next sentence is a reference to what can happen next - with a clear sexual insinuation.

---

She’s saying the beat is so good it makes you wanna dance and have fun — sick means it’s insanely good. The disco stick is a clear sexual metaphor for a man’s private parts — so she’s basically flirting, saying she wants to “ride” it.

And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a f\*\* about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore

---

He wants to trust in her, but is almost impossible now - probably because she lead him to thousands of disappointments. Even though it, he wants to believe in her, but she didn't give any reason for that

---

He’s saying he can’t trust her anymore — she’s let him down so many times that now he’s questioning if he ever really cared at all. Makes me wonder means he’s doubting everything about their relationship. He wants something real to believe in, but she gives him nothing to hold on to.

Hey hey, you you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one

---

A cool and dancing song with the theme of love among people. Avril is saying she has a better fit to him, especially based on the clip, where the current girlfriend \[are -> IS] the complete opposite of the guy, while Avril is the perfect match.

---

It’s a fun, upbeat song about stealing someone’s boyfriend. Avril is saying she’d be a better match for him — she thinks his current girlfriend doesn’t suit him at all. In the music video, the girlfriend is totally the opposite of him, while Avril is the perfect match and more fun.

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away

He let his feeling roam free, he showed his real side, but it looked useless, maybe because he still \[feeling -> feels] bad or because the people he told everything just didn't give a damn to it.

---

He’s letting all his feelings out — all his pain, frustration, anger — but it feels pointless because he keeps digging deeper just to throw it all away. It shows how tiring it is to open up when nobody cares or when it doesn’t fix anything inside him.
