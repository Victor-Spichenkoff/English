Let’s have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick

---

She is saying the song is really nice and dancing. The next sentence is a reference to what can happen next - with a clear sexual insinuation.

---

She’s saying the beat is so good it makes you wanna dance and have fun — sick means it’s insanely good. The disco stick is a clear sexual metaphor for a man’s private parts — so she’s basically flirting, saying she wants to “ride” it.

And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a f\*\* about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore

---

He wants to trust in her, but is almost impossible now - probably because she lead him to thousands of disappointments. Even though it, he wants to believe in her, but she didn't give any reason for that

---

He’s saying he can’t trust her anymore — she’s let him down so many times that now he’s questioning if he ever really cared at all. Makes me wonder means he’s doubting everything about their relationship. He wants something real to believe in, but she gives him nothing to hold on to.

Hey hey, you you, I don’t like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one

---

A cool and dancing song with the theme of love among people. Avril is saying she has a better fit to him, especially based on the clip, where the current girlfriend \[are -> IS] the complete opposite of the guy, while Avril is the perfect match.

---

It’s a fun, upbeat song about stealing someone’s boyfriend. Avril is saying she’d be a better match for him — she thinks his current girlfriend doesn’t suit him at all. In the music video, the girlfriend is totally the opposite of him, while Avril is the perfect match and more fun.

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away

---

He let his feeling roam free, he showed his real side, but it looked useless, maybe because he still \[feeling -> feels] bad or because the people he told everything just didn't give a damn to it.

---

He’s letting all his feelings out — all his pain, frustration, anger — but it feels pointless because he keeps digging deeper just to throw it all away. It shows how tiring it is to open up when nobody cares or when it doesn’t fix anything inside him.

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don’t know where it goes
But it’s home to me and I walk alone

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This song is very direct, it's all about loneliness, but the singer [don't seen -> doesn't (really) see] it as a bad thing, but something that is already part of his life - his one and only reality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This song is pretty straightforward — it’s all about loneliness and isolation. But the singer doesn’t really see it as something bad. It’s more like something that defines him — this lonely road is the only reality he knows, and he’s used to walking it alone.

I’m your biggest fan, I’ll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

She's inverting the roles, now she is the obsessive and will follow the paparazzis, destroy their [privacities -> só singular], just like they used to do with her. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
She’s flipping the roles — now she’s the obsessive one, following them like paparazzi do to celebrities. She’s basically saying she’ll invade their privacy and chase them until she gets their love and attention, just like they used to do with her.

It’s not always rainbows and butterflies
It’s compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door’s always open
You can come anytime you want, yeah

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reference to rainbows and butterflies means that a relationship can't move along with just fantasies, this can be reach just with compromise, and that is what he's offering. She seems [confuse -> ed] now, not really ready for it, but he's saying that will wait for her, always with his heart open. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reference to “rainbows and butterflies” means that a relationship can’t survive on just fantasies — it takes compromise to keep it going, and that’s what he’s offering her. She seems confused right now, maybe not ready for it yet, but he’s telling her he’ll wait, with his heart always open for whenever she’s ready.

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I’ve felt so long
(Erase all the pain till it’s gone)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This part is about redemption. He wants to change, to fix what is wrong and hurting, feel new and good things. He wants to vanish the pain from his life

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who’d think I’d find
Someone like you to call mine


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

That's a declaration, she is so wonderful that rocked his world, like [a-. AN] earthquake. Now he [makes -> do é melhor] and gives anything to her, 'cause she deserves it all for being such a rare and lovely woman

Why won’t you answer me?
Your silence is slowly killing me
Girl, you really got me bad

He's calling her, but she's ignoring and this is putting him down, slowly killing his hope

Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren’t so great
“It tastes like you only sweeter.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These ain't good memories at all. This part uses [ironic -> irony] to tell her the time they've spent together was just a waste of time for him. The final verse, by saying that this ironic comment is sweeter than her, shows how terrible and toxic the relationship was.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
These aren’t good memories at all. This part uses irony to tell her that the time they spent together was pretty much a waste for him. The last line — “it tastes like you, only sweeter” — shows how bitter and toxic the relationship really was.
