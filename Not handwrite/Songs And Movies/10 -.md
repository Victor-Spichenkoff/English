Piece Of Me
🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨🟨
I’m Miss bad media karma
Another day, another drama
Guess I can’t see the harm

And with a kid on my arm
I’m still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?

"Piece of me" may mean literally the privacy invasion many paparazzi do to take pictures of her body or even the media willing to take everything possible to get audience with a scrutiny on her life.

Is be more like me and be less like you

I don’t want to be the one
The battles always choose
‘Cause inside I realize
That I’m the one confused

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[The battles choose him, he is just living and the troubles always find a way till him]

He no longer wants to be the one to choose the battles, because he's too [confuse -> confused, é adjetivo, não verbo]. This leads him to take bad decisions and fight for dump or senseless things - exhausting his energy for things he shouldn't even care [about, sempre precisa de complemento]

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
He no longer wants to be the one who always ends up fighting battles, because he feels too confused. This makes him take bad decisions and waste energy fighting pointless things he shouldn’t even care about.
