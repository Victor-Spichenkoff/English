I’m like the ring leader
I call the shots
I’m like a firecracker
I make it hot

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This song was released at a turbulent moment in her life, with a lot of problems related to the fame and exposition. But here, she puts herself in the center of everything - at the spotlight as said earlier in the song. She's [exactly -> ficaria melhor] where she [faltou um IS] meant to be, at center of the ring and controlling everything. The last two lines are references for her real presentations, usually with a lot of sensual things, and also a provocation to all those who criticized her body

This song came out during a turbulent time in her life, with a lot of problems related to fame and exposure. But here, she puts herself right in the center of everything — in the spotlight, just like she says earlier in the song. She’s exactly where she’s meant to be: in the center of the ring, running the whole show. The last two lines reference her real performances, usually packed with sensual elements, and they’re also a provocation to everyone who ever criticized her body.

Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love [would]
If they knew how misery loved me

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The dance is so intense that they are dead even before the half way. Anyway, it's still being the lives they like. But for the singer it's a question of misery. I can see a certain dig about the preferences of many in having fun even in terrible situations, like in a deep economic crises.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dance is so intense that they’re basically dead before they’re even halfway through. Still, it’s the kind of life they choose. But for the singer, it’s more like a miserable game. There’s a clear jab at how people prefer to party and keep up appearances, even when everything is falling apart — like during a deep economic crisis.

There’s only two types of people in the world
The ones that entertain and the ones that observe
Well baby, I’m a put-on-a-show kind of girl
Don’t like the backseat, gotta be first

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quite direct. This part confirms that she's build to be in the center of the stage - the main attraction. This part is also a clear jab for those who not only watches, but also likes to dig in to find troubles and reasons to build up critics against those who are at the top - just like the media did to her.

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

"feel my heat" looks like a metaphor for proximity, and that's the moment she can see his demons through his eyes - known as the window [for -> to] the soul. This means these demons are things or even a dark side of him that he tries to hide deep in his soul, but that still there

She wants to go home, but nobody’s home
That’s where she lies, broken inside
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes, broken inside

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

She pretends to have a normal life, with a home to go, but she didn't. The fact it uses "home" and not "house" gives us a meaning that she has no secure and warm place to return, no one to take care of her. Anyway, she dries her tears and keep going, even broken inside

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
She pretends to have a normal life, with a home to go [back to -> mais completo], but she [doesn’t -> presente, ela ainda não tem]. The fact that it says “home” instead of “house” shows us she doesn’t have a safe, warm place to return [to -> evita final solto] — no one to take care of her. Anyway, she dries her tears and [keeps -> 3°] going, even though she’s broken inside.

I’m just the same as I was
Now don’t you understand
That I’m never changing who I am

Probably, she had tried to change him, make him fit her expectations. But he didn't, and now she's complaining about it, but he always said and showed he won't change

Probably, she [sem had, daria ideia de muito distante] tried to change him, [to -> usou antes, é bom usar agora] make him fit her expectations. But he didn’t, and now she’s complaining about it — but he always said and showed he wouldn’t change.

The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too

She's completely in love for him. Any distance means a lack that even makes her feel like a part of herself fade away.

She's completely in love [for -> with] him. Any distance [feels -> melhor que means para distância] like something is missing, like a part of herself fades away

And the sun will set for you
And the shadow of the day
Will embrace the world in grey
And the sun will set for you

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's almost a curse. "shadow of the day" shows us that the dark will be around who he's cursing - meaning that the set of the sun is a metaphor and darkness will embrace him everywhere. The fact it repeats the first line sounds like a promise of continuity and infinity, like a cycle

I don’t know what’s worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream.
I don’t know why I instigate
And say what I don’t mean.

He's fighting or having a rough argument, but now he realize that this maybe worthless - even for no real reason. He shouts and even hurts the other person, but everything seems stupid
