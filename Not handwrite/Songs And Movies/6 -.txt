And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby

[It's also allows] -> [ there's also another interpretation, o outro não funciona no inglês] a second interpretation: she got her wings stolen - meaning he stole her power, he is putting her under his control, this creates [a->an] even deeper feeling of dependence. This songs got a new layer when you realize what was happening in Britney life at that moment.

-------------------------------------------------
This is one of the most sentimental songs I've ever heard — it really hits different.
This part expresses a feeling of emotional dependence. She tries to move on, but it's impossible. Without him, she doesn't have the strength to fly — which could be understood as moving forward in life.
There's also another interpretation: it's as if he stole her wings — meaning he took away her power, keeping her under his emotional control. That adds an even deeper layer of dependence.
This song gains extra weight when you realize what Britney was going through at that time in her life.

Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure
Of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

-------------------------------------------------

This part says about someone putting pressure on him to fit a mold, but not any mold, the mold of being perfectly identical to him, removing all of his identity. This leads us to the final part (Caught in the undertow), that suggests the lost of control, just keep going, whatever it's good or bad

-------------------------------------------------
This part describes someone being pressured to become something they’re not — specifically, to fit the mold of someone else’s expectations.
It’s not just any mold, but a demand to completely erase their identity and become a copy of someone else.
The final line, "Caught in the undertow," adds a sense of helplessness, as if he's being dragged along by forces beyond his control — with no say, no escape, whether things are good or bad.

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Let’s have some fun, this beat is sick
I wanna take a ride on your disco stick
