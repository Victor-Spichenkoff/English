I woke up earlier today, by five a.m, almost six, but still earlier. I play a little bit with my phone and then finally start my day. I had breakfast, just a little cake. As always, I played with my dog 'till nine AM. with a new glue, I tried to fix my football boot, that had a tiny problem: the hole sole was out. I hope that I had been able to fix that. By afternoon, I started my arm training. As aways, pull-ups and push-ups. Watched "A usurpadora" at my granny house and got back to my studies. Now, at nineteen, I'm writing this diary to learn english. A few minutes before, I was peeling a few potatoes for dinner.

NOVAS:
peel/peel out - descascar


Correção: 
but still earlier -> ... than usual (precisa de complemento para não ser vago)
I play a little bit with my phone -> I PLAYED A BIT ON my phone
hole (buraco) -> whole (Todo) 
I hope that I had been able to fix that -> I hope I was able
arm traing -> arm workout (treino físico) 
grandma’s house -> usar com 's
at nineteen (ideia de idade) -> at 7 p.m
a few (ênfase em ser pouco ) -> some (para dizer que foram algumas, mas sem dizer qunatas)
