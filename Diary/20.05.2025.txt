Today, I trained football for 1 hour and a few minutes more. earlier, in the afternoon, I watched my novel and and fixed my grandma sink, that was clogged. Also applied for some jobs on LinkedIn and listened to musics to practice my English. And finally to end the day, I gonna play Assetto Corsa, the first and best one, and read a book.
